# React + Typescript boilerplate

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

### Current external packages

- react-hot-toast
- react-query
- tailwindcss

#### Tips

- If you want to add new providers, make sure to add inside Provider.tsx inside utils folder.
- If you are making services for api calls, you can use services folder to do so.
- Make sure to use pnpm and pnpm only. We don't need more than one lock file.
